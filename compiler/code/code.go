	// OpArray operate array with one operand:
	// Compile:
	// 1. compile all of its elements;
	// 2. compiling them results in instructions that leave N values on the VM's stack, where N is the number of element in the array literal;
	// 3. we're going to emit an OpArray instruction with the operand being N, the number of elements.
	// Run:
	// when the VM then executes the OpArray instruction it takes the N elements off the stack, builds an *object.Array out of them,
	// and pushes that on to the stack.
	OpArray
	// OpHash process object.Hash
	// Just like an array, its final value can't be determined during compile time.
	// Doubly so, actually because instead of having N elements, a hash in Monkey has N key and N value and all of them are created by expressions.
	// The operand specifies the number of keys and values sitting on the stack.
	// Compile :
	// 1. compile all of its keys and its values;
	// 2. compiling them results in instructions that leave 2 * N values on the VM's stack, where N is the number of keys in hash literals;
	// 3. emit an OpHash [2 * N] instruction.
	// Run :
	// 1. Read operand value;
	// 2. pop keys and values from stack and build an object.Hash and push that on to the stack.
	OpHash
	// OpIndex Instead of treating the index operator in combination with a specific data structure as a special case,
	// we'll build a generic index operator into the compiler and VM. So it's worked equally well with both array indices and hash indices.
	// for OpIndex to work, there need to be two values sitting on the top of the stack:
	// the object to be indexed and the object serving as the index.
	// When the VM executes OpIndex it should take both off the stack, perform the index operation, and put the result back on.
	OpIndex
	// OpCall calling convention, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calling_convention
	// With OpCall defined, we are now able to get a function on to the stack of our VM and call it.
	// What we still need is a way to tell the VM to return from a called function.
	// More specifically, we need to differentiate between two cases where the Vm has to return from a function.
	// 1. the execution of a function actually returning something;
	// 2. the execution of a function ends without anything being returned;
	// --------------------------------------
	// Assuming we have a code snippet in monkey programming language:
	// fn(){} ()
	// The code snippet consists of two parts:
	// 1. the definition of the function;
	// 2. the calling of the function.
	// What really concerns me is the second part -- the calling of the function.
	// It produces two major instruction in compiling procedure :
	// OpConstant The first instruction retrieves CompiledFunction from constant pool and pushes result onto stack.
	// OpCall The second instruction pops the result from stack and execute it, that's why OpCall doesn't require an operand
	// --------------------------------------
	OpCall
	// OpReturnValue It doesn't have any arguments. The value to be returned has to sit on top of the stack.
	OpReturnValue
	// OpReturn representing a function that neither explicitly nor implicitly returns a value
	OpReturn
	// OpSetLocal binding local variable with one-byte operand.
	OpSetLocal
	// OpGetLocal retrieve local variable with one-byte operand.
